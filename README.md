Medical Translation in the History of Modern Genomics (TRANSGENE) is an ERC-funded Starting Grant that looks at the history of genomic science across three different organisms: the baker's yeast S. cerevisiae, the domestic pig Sus scrofa and Homo sapiens. Our focus is investigating how the perceived potential of 'the genome' of each organism - as a resource for clinical, agricultural or industrial interventions - changed over time, and how these changing perceptions shaped the organisation of different initiatives to sequence human, yeast and pig DNA. The project started in October 2016 and will conclude at the end of September 2021. One of the outcomes of our research is a dataset documenting who determined new human, yeast and pig DNA sequences, when those new sequences were determined and where they were published. This dataset is available at the University of Edinburgh data repository and contains more than 13 million records. For more information about the project see www.stis.ed.ac.uk/transgene
